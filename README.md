# CovidSQL is a non-business project I've passionately worked on in my spare time to showcase some of my skills in SQL and Data Analysis.
# Some of the key focus in this project is being able to utilize SQL query in order to gain data from 2 datasets, Death and Vaccination, both Excel files are located in the Repository.
# The data sets, Death and Vaccination are taken from a larger data set called Covid Data on the website. I created two datasets in order for me to work on for this project. The data are analyzed, cleaned, free of bias, and organized to look simple. 
# Some of the features include, MAX/MIN, OVER PARTITION, CTEs, CREATE TABLE/DROP TABLE, JOIN, and other complex SQL queries used to gather data from two data sets.
#I created a visual on my Tableau website that features some information on these datasets.
